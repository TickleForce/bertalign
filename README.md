# Bertalign for Ancient Greek

This repo is a fork of [Bertalign](https://github.com/bfsujason/bertalign), a mulitlingual sentence aligner, updated for aligning ancient Greek texts with English translations.

Bertalign is designed to facilitate the construction of multilingual parallel corpora and translation memories, which have a wide range of applications in translation-related research such as corpus-based translation studies, contrastive linguistics, computer-assisted translation, translator education and machine translation.

## Approach

Bertalign uses [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) to represent source and target sentences so that semantically similar sentences in different languages are mapped onto similar vector spaces. Then a two-step algorithm based on dynamic programming is performed: 1) Step 1 finds the 1-1 alignments for approximate anchor points; 2) Step 2 limits the search path to the anchor points and extracts all the valid alignments with 1-many, many-1 or many-to-many relations between the source and target sentences.

## Performance

The gold alignment dataset is based on translations of the Didache, letter of Polycarp, a Greek reader, and works of Josephus.

LaBSE on eval dataset:
```
 ---------------------------------
|             |  Strict |    Lax  |
| Precision   |   0.946 |   0.999 |
| Recall      |   0.935 |   1.000 |
| F1          |   0.941 |   1.000 |
 ---------------------------------
```

Using a sentence transformer trained on Greek-English parallel data: 
```
 ---------------------------------
|             |  Strict |    Lax  |
| Precision   |   0.970 |   0.994 |
| Recall      |   0.956 |   1.000 |
| F1          |   0.963 |   0.997 |
 ---------------------------------
```
